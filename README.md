### Hi there!

I'm Harmeet. I work as a lead application architect at Egon Zehnder. From academics background, I was almost the chartered accountant, but my curiosity brought me into Application development. I never been activitly open-sourcing, but i want to spend sometime sharing my knowledge via blogs or tutorials.

<!-- Most of my open-source 🚀 [projects](https://trekhleb.dev/projects/) below 👇🏻 are focused on one thing -  **to help people learn** 📚. You may use these projects to learn about _algorithms in JavaScript_ and get prepared for _technical interviews_, or to learn _Python_ syntax and start experimenting with _machine learning algorithms_ and math behind them, etc.

I also write 📝 [articles](https://trekhleb.dev/blog/) about life, web-development and machine learning.

Currently, developing the ✍🏻 [okso.app](https://okso.app/) online drawing app. -->
